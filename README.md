## What Is Robotics?

Robotics is an engineering discipline that deals with the idea, design, construction, and operation of robots. The goal of robotics is to develop intelligent devices that can aid people in a number of ways.
Robotics may take many different shapes. A robot can be human-like or take the shape of a robotic application, such as robotic process automation, which mimics how humans interact with software to conduct repetitive, rules-based activities.

## History and Development of Robots

In the 1950s, inventor George Devol and engineer Joseph Engelberger developed *Unimate*, the first industrial robot. In the patent for "Programmed Article Transfer", which was granted in 1961, it reads as follows:

"The present invention relates to the automatic operation of machinery, particularly the handling apparatus, and to automatic control apparatus suited for such machinery."

In 1961, this robotic arm was used in General Motors production. The machine performed the task of transporting die-cast parts from an assembly line and then welding these parts to car bodies. Additionally, *Unimate* was also able of pouring drinks. How multifunctional the robot could be used can be seen in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hxsWeVtb-JQ).

In the following years other Robots were developed that were used in the automotive industry. In 1973, Kuka, a company from Augsburg, launched the first six-axis, purely electrically operated robot. A year later, the Swedish company Asea, now ABB, followed with a robotic arm that was programmed with a computer for the first time. In the subsequent two decades, besides Kuka and ABB, manufacturers such as Fanuc and Yaskawa established themselves in the robot market.

#### The characteristics of Cobots

A __cobot__ is an industrial robot that is designed to work together with humans. Therefore, the robot can be used in close vicinity to humans without the latter being exposed to a risk of injury. To guarantee this, the robots are limited to a minimum of their capabilities. The term __cobot__ is short for __collaborative robot__. Typically, cobots are more mobile and easier to move, which distinguishes them from typical industrial robots.

## Application of robots in the healthcare sector 

* __Surgical-Assistance Robots__
    * Surgical assist robots support surgeons performing complex operations using AI and computer vision-enabled technologies, thereby achieving new levels of speed and accuracy. The ability to use video transmission from the operating room to other locations nearby or far away also allows surgeons to consult with other specialists in their field. This allows patients to include the best surgeons in their procedures and increases the quality of care patients receive. Some surgical robots may even be able to perform tasks autonomously, allowing surgeons to monitor procedures from a console.
    * Currently, surgical assistance robots are mainly used in orthopedic surgery and for minimally invasive operations in the upper body.

* __Modular Robots__
    * Modular robots complement other systems and can be configured to perform different tasks and assist in rehabilitation, for example.  In healthcare, these include therapeutic exoskeleton robots and prosthetic robotic arms and legs.

* __Nursing Robots__
    * The use of robots in care is much more diverse. There are care robots such as Pepper, which communicates with people in need of care as a humanoid robot *(social robot)* and makes their daily lives easier and can also mentally activate its counterpart. Furthermore, care robots *(collaborative)* are used for heavy physical activities in care, such as turning or changing the position of patients, in order to spare the nursing staff. In addition to relieving the physical strain, the use of such robots also requires fewer nursing staff due to increased efficiency.

## Application of robots in agriculture 

Robots in agriculture help improve both productivity and sustainability. They can specialize by for example only spraying plants that need pesticides with pesticides, and leave the nearby plants alone, [like this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qg9Zubc7lok). They also improve the working conditions for the farmers. 

Robots can be used for harvesting fruits, [like this robot picking grapes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVvs6_Wx2HM). Or for collecting information, [for example differentiating weeds form corns](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eof99XfoFfY). 

When it comes to research and development some of the [Robotnik](https://robotnik.eu/robotics-applications-in-agriculture/) projects are BACCHUS, AGROBOFOOD and CORSECT. Where Bacchus has the ability to both collet data and do harvesting at the same time. While Agrobofood aims do create a digital transformation in the agricultural sector. Corsect on the other hand works on optimizing insect production. 

According to [Owen-Hill (2022)](https://blog.robotiq.com/top-10-robotic-applications-in-the-agricultural-industry) the top 10 Applications of Robots agriculture is:

## Application Of Robots in Military

Robots in military help to reduce the cost of war on human lives. Today the military uses
robots in various tasks especially those that are difficult for human beings or those deemed to
dangerous to the lives of the soldiers and with costly repercussions. This is aimed at reducing the
number of soldiers lost to war while meeting the needs of the military. In addition to being able
to operate in harsh weather conditions as well as terrain, robots used in this field are remotely
controlled and well equipped with cameras, sensors and mechanical limbs to be able to perform
their tasks.
There are two distinct types of robots used by the military; the ones that inflict damage to
the enemy, while others are used to collect information as well as surveillance and
reconnaissance.
When it comes to robot development in this space, some of the projects include the
[Robobee](https://www.roboticscareer.org/news-and-events/news/23031#:~:text=the%20near%20future.-,The%20Robobee,-Developed%20by%20Harvard%E2%80%99s), [Dogo](https://www.roboticscareer.org/news-and-events/news/23031#:~:text=for%20crop%20pollination.-,The%20DOGO,-The%20DOGO%20is) and [Saffir](https://www.roboticscareer.org/news-and-events/news/23031#:~:text=safe%20from%20harm.-,SAFFiR,-Created%20by%20engineering). Where the [Robobee](https://www.roboticscareer.org/news-and-events/news/23031#:~:text=the%20near%20future.-,The%20Robobee,-Developed%20by%20Harvard%E2%80%99s) manages remotely controlled aerial surveillance
without detection. while [Dogo](https://www.roboticscareer.org/news-and-events/news/23031#:~:text=for%20crop%20pollination.-,The%20DOGO,-The%20DOGO%20is) is capable of ground reconnaissance with both defensive and
offensive capabilities. [Saffir](https://www.roboticscareer.org/news-and-events/news/23031#:~:text=safe%20from%20harm.-,SAFFiR,-Created%20by%20engineering) on the hand is built to tackle fires on sea vessels and can even see-
through smoke.
According to [internal research journal of engineering and technology, of the Sinhgad
institute of technology and science, dated 05 May,2017](https://www.academia.edu/download/53592731/IRJET-V4I5490.pdf), key applications of the robots used in the military include:
1. Surveillance: being able to offer real time monitoring of the field and areas of
interest.
2. Reconnaissance: getting to the area of interest for information gathering and back.
3. Triangulation: being able to locate specific targets with precision and accuracy.
4. Threat detection: identifying threats such as landmines, hostiles, toxic gasses and
fires
5. Assistance in rescues: being able to identify humans for rescue through tough and dangerous situations.


## Application of robots in the warehouse sector

### What is a warehouse robot?

Warehouse robotics involves the use of automated systems, robots and specialized software to automate the flow of goods and increase productivity. These technologies are used to transport materials, perform various tasks, and automate warehouse processes. The relevance of robotics in areas of supply chain, distribution center and warehouse management has increased significantly in the last decade.

### What types of robots are applied in warehouses?

#### Automated Guided Vehicles (AGV)

Automatic Guided Vehicles are transport devices similar to forklifts that are used to move materials, supplies and inventory within a warehouse facility. The technologies operate without drivers, instead following set routes defined by wires, magnetic strips, rails, sensors embedded in the floor or other physical guides. Other robots use cameras and infrared to identify obstacles and avoid collisions.

#### Automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS)

AS/RS are computerized systems used to automate inventory management and storage/retrieval of goods on demand. They include stacker cranes for pallets, mini-load systems or the automatic pallet shuttle system, which are usually coupled with warehouse management software and allow the rapid removal and placement of products. The fact that these technologies operate twenty-four hours a day enables the continuous movement of goods, increasing the speed with which an order can be processed and materials handled. 

#### Articulated robotic arms

Articulated robotic arms look like multi-jointed limbs and are used to handle products and distribution centers.  These robots have components that perform rotating and conveying motions, consequently they can rotate, lift and maneuver objects. The arms can work completely independently or together with warehouse workers.Robots facilitate order assembly and can assist warehouse workers in handling heavy loads.

### What are benefits of warehouse robots?

#### 1. Increased productivity and efficiency

By using robots in the warehouse, work becomes far faster and more efficient. For example, warehouse workers can stay at the picking stations and wait for the AS/RS and conveyors to bring them the goods for order assembly. As a result, they don't need to run around the warehouse looking for the items they need.

#### 2. Increased accuracy in workflows

If goods are managed manually, there is an increased risk of error - for instance, putting an item in the wrong place or putting together an order without the appropriate item - which can cause high costs in the company. Robots, by contrast, follow the instructions of the management software regarding the handling, picking and sorting of goods. Consequently, a high level of accuracy is ensured in order handling and warehousing.

#### 3. Collaboration with warehouse workers

Robots facilitate warehouse workers' routine tasks and help them be more efficient. For example, these machines can move large volumes of goods without any problems, allowing the warehouse worker to focus on other tasks with higher added value.

#### 4. Increased Safety

Handling of goods is associated with an increased risk of accidents, especially with heavy loads or when handling in uncomfortable positions and performing repetitive motions. Robots perform various tasks accurately and without the risk of accidents.


    
## Advantages of robots

* In some situations, they can improve productivity, efficiency, quality, and consistency.
* Robots, unlike humans, do not become bored.
* They may continually repeat the same procedure till they wear out.
* Robots can be used to perform monotonous work, giving humans more time to focus on critical aspects or creative tasks. 
* Robots can operate in hazardous conditions, such as with harmful chemicals or in places with high radiation.
* Robots can also work in extreme environments, whether underwater, in extreme heat, in wind, or even in space. And they can be used wherever human safety is at risk.
* They may be exceedingly exact, down to fractions of an inch, which makes them very valuable in the manufacture of microelectronics. Some robots have sensors and actuators that outperform humans.
* They do not have the same physical or environmental demands as humans.


## Disadvantages of robots

* Robots are displacing human workers in various areas, which might cause economic concerns.
* Robots can exclusively handle tasks, but they usually cannot deal with unexpected situations.
* Because of current robotics technology, most machines are less dexterous than humans and cannot compete with humans' capacity to comprehend what they perceive. But researchers are working on producing robots that can better detect their surroundings.
* Overall, robots can only perform what they are taught to do, which means they cannot improvise (although AI and machine learning is changing this).
* Robots with practical applications are typically costly in terms of original cost, maintenance, the requirement for additional components, and the need to be programmed to perform the task.
* Robots have no emotions and have no conscience. As a result, empathy in the workplace decreases.
* Legal  challenges  in  robots  have  been  a  topic  of  debate  for  many  decades.  As mentioned earlier someone  must be held  accountable for any  crime committed by robots.

## Conclusion 

Robots may be one of the greatest inventions ever, but we must utilize their power with prudence. Perhaps it is a good idea to have industrial robots that can reduce human danger, raise production, and increase profit. But it is insane to design or build anything that threatens the very existence of its creator. Although humanoid robots are still primarily confined to science fiction, robotic devices are all around us. These engineering marvels currently assist us in many aspects of life and have the potential to influence our future.

Despite a number of advantages and downsides, one thing is certain: persons with robotics expertise will be in great demand in the future. There will almost certainly always be work in the field of robotics, whether it be designing, programming, or maintaining robots.
